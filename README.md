These are my projects on Data Analysis.

## Data Preprocessing Project
To prepare a report for a bank’s loan division based on customer’s marital status and number of children. Identify factors that impact whether they will default on a loan. 
The data already had some customers’ credit worthiness data points. Based on the historical data, a report was created to identify which category of customers were prone to default thereby also helping the bank identify the ability of a potential borrower to repay their loan.
