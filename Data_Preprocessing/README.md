# Data Preprocessing
## Introduction
This is one of my first projects on Data Processing. The main intention was to familiarize the following concepts:
- understanding the business requirement
- opening a large data set in Python
- develop a dataframe using Pandas
- analyze the raw data to identify data errors
- strategies used for cleaning data 
    - missing values
    - erroenous values
    - duplicate data
- strategies for analyzing data
    - data type conversion *(for e.g. string <> numbger)*
    - categorizing data


## Project description
To prepare a report for a bank’s loan division based on customer’s marital status and number of children. Identify factors that impact whether they will default on a loan. 
The data already had some customers’ credit worthiness data points. Based on the historical data, a report was created to identify which category of customers were prone to default thereby also helping the bank identify the ability of a potential borrower to repay their loan.

## Languages & Libraries used
- Python
- Pandas
- NLTK (SnowballStemmer)


## Key skills learned
How to handle the following situations in a large dataset in Python:

- Identifying data type
- Missing values (NaN and None)
- Duplicate values
- Erroneous values
- Data categorization

## Keys steps followed
